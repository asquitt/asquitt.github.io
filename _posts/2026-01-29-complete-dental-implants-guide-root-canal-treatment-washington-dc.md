## What Are Dental Implants?

Dental implants replace missing tooth roots with titanium posts surgically placed into your jawbone. They're the gold standard for tooth replacement because they integrate with your bone structure. Unlike bridges or dentures, implants preserve jawbone health and restore full chewing function naturally.

## When Do You Need Implants vs Root Canal Treatment?

Washington DC dental implants become necessary when root canal treatment can't save your tooth:

- Severe tooth fractures extending below the gum line
- Advanced gum disease compromising tooth stability
- Failed previous root canal treatment
- Extensive decay destroying too much tooth structure

## The Implant Process

Our professionals utilize modern equipment for precise, comfortable placement:

1. Comprehensive consultation and digital treatment planning
2. Minimally invasive implant surgery
3. Osseointegration healing period (3-6 months)
4. Custom crown attachment and final restoration

## Benefits of Dental Implants
