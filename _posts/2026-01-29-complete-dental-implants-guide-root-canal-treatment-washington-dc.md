# Complete Dental Implants Guide: Root Canal Treatment Washington DC

Are you facing tooth loss after failed root canal treatment Washington DC? Connecticut Ave Dental Studio helps Washington DC patients regain their confidence with dental implants that look, feel, and function like natural teeth.

## What Are Dental Implants?

Dental implants replace missing tooth roots with titanium posts placed directly into your jawbone. These posts bond with your bone, creating a strong foundation for custom crowns.

Benefits include:
- Permanent solution that lasts decades
- Natural look and feel
- Better chewing and speaking
- Protects jawbone health

## When Root Canal Treatment Isn't Enough

Root canal treatment Washington DC saves many damaged teeth. However, severe infection, extensive decay, or major trauma sometimes requires tooth removal. Dental implants offer the best replacement option.

Our team uses modern diagnostic tools to evaluate your situation and recommend the right treatment.

## The Implant Process Made Simple

The process happens in planned stages. First, we place the titanium post in your jawbone using precise techniques. Healing takes 3-6 months while the implant bonds with your bone.

Next, we attach your custom crown that matches your natural teeth perfectly. Our professionals guide you through every step.
