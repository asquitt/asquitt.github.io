# What Are Dental Implants: Complete Guide for DC Patients

Dental implants are titanium posts surgically placed into your jawbone to replace missing tooth roots. These revolutionary tooth replacement solutions provide DC residents with a permanent fix for missing teeth.

## How Dental Implants Work

Dental implants fuse with your jawbone through osseointegration. This creates a strong foundation for crowns, bridges, or dentures. The three-part system includes:

- Titanium implant (artificial root)
- Abutment (connector piece)
- Crown (visible tooth portion)

## Benefits of Dental Implants in DC

Unlike dentures or bridges, implants preserve your jawbone and prevent facial sagging. They feel and function like natural teeth. You can eat, speak, and smile confidently.

Key advantages include:

- 95% success rate
- Lifetime durability with proper care
- No damage to adjacent teeth
- Easy maintenance

## Are You a Candidate?

Most adults with good oral health qualify for dental implants. You need adequate jawbone density and healthy gums. Smokers and diabetics may need additional evaluation before treatment.
