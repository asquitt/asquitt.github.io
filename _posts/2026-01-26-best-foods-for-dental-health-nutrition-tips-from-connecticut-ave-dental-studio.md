# Best Foods for Dental Health: Nutrition Tips from Connecticut Ave Dental Studio

What you eat directly impacts your oral health—some foods strengthen teeth while others fuel decay. The right dietary choices can naturally protect your smile between dental visits.

## Calcium-Rich Champions

Dairy products rebuild tooth enamel through calcium and phosphorus:

- Milk
- Cheese (neutralizes mouth acid)
- Greek yogurt
- Leafy greens like kale

These minerals remineralize weakened enamel, reversing early decay.

## Crunchy Fruits and Vegetables

Crispy produce mechanically cleans teeth while stimulating saliva production:

- Apples
- Carrots
- Celery
- Bell peppers

Increased saliva flow naturally rinses away food particles and neutralizes harmful acids.

## Protein Powerhouses

Lean proteins supply phosphorus, which partners with calcium for enamel protection:

- Fish (especially salmon with vitamin D)
- Eggs
- Chicken
- Nuts and seeds

Vitamin D enhances calcium absorption, maximizing enamel strengthening.

## Smart Hydration

Water flushes bacteria and food debris while maintaining optimal saliva levels. Choose water over sugary drinks that feed cavity-causing bacteria.

## Foods to Limit

Minimize sugary snacks, sodas, and sticky candies. These create acidic conditions that erode enamel and promote bacterial growth.

## Professional Care Matters
