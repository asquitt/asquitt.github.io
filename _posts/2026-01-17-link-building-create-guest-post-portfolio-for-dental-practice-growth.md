# Link Building: Create Guest Post Portfolio for Dental Practice Growth

Building a strategic guest post portfolio drives qualified traffic and establishes dental authority. Link building through targeted guest posting helps Connecticut Ave Dental Studio reach new patients while boosting search rankings.

## Your Guest Post Workflow

**Step 1: Research Target Sites**
Identify health websites accepting dental content. Search "write for us" + "dental health," "oral care," or "wellness." Focus on sites with 10,000+ monthly visitors and Domain Authority above 30.

**Step 2: Pitch Strategically**
Lead with your unique angle. Mention specific articles you've read on their site. Propose 3-4 topic ideas that solve reader problems.

**Step 3: Create Value-First Content**
Write actionable articles addressing real dental concerns. Include your practice link naturally within author bio or relevant context.

## Dental-Specific Guest Post Topics

Target these high-impact subjects:
- "5 Signs You Need Emergency Dental Care"
- "How to Choose the Right Dentist for Your Family"
- "Dental Anxiety Solutions That Actually Work"
- "Insurance vs. Cash Pay: What Dental Patients Should Know"

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics monthly:
- Referral traffic from guest posts
- New patient inquiries from published articles
- Domain Authority improvements
- Local search ranking changes for target keywords

## Building Long-Term Relationships

Focus on 5-10 quality sites rather than dozens of low-value placements. Engage with their content regularly. Offer to answer reader questions in comments.
