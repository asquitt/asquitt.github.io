# 5 Essential Dental Hygiene Tips for a Healthier Smile

Poor oral hygiene affects over 90% of adults worldwide, leading to preventable dental problems. These evidence-based dental hygiene tips will help you maintain excellent oral health and avoid costly complications.

## Daily Brushing and Flossing Basics

Brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste for two minutes. Use gentle, circular motions to remove plaque effectively without damaging your gums. Floss daily to clean between teeth where your toothbrush can't reach, preventing 40% of tooth decay.

## Professional Dental Hygiene Tips

- Replace your toothbrush every three months or after illness
- Use antibacterial mouthwash to reduce plaque by 20%
- Limit sugary and acidic foods that weaken enamel
- Stay hydrated to support natural saliva production
- Schedule professional cleanings every six months

## Advanced Care for Better Results

Electric toothbrushes remove up to 21% more plaque than manual brushing. Clean your tongue daily to eliminate odor-causing bacteria and improve breath freshness. Wait 30-60 minutes after eating before brushing to protect softened enamel.
