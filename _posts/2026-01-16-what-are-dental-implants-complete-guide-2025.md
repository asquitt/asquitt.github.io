# What Are Dental Implants: Complete Guide 2025

Missing teeth affect your confidence, eating habits, and oral health. What are dental implants? They're titanium posts surgically placed into your jawbone to replace missing tooth roots, providing a strong foundation for crowns, bridges, or dentures.

## How Do Dental Implants Work?

The process involves three precise steps:

• **Implant placement**: Biocompatible titanium post inserted into jawbone
• **Osseointegration**: Bone fuses with implant over 3-6 months  
• **Crown attachment**: Custom-made tooth secured to implant

This creates a permanent solution that looks, feels, and functions like natural teeth.

## Types of Dental Implants

Two main types serve different needs:

• **Endosteal implants**: Most common, placed directly into jawbone for maximum stability
• **Subperiosteal implants**: Sit on jawbone surface, ideal for patients with insufficient bone height

Your oral surgeon evaluates bone density and jaw structure to determine the best option.

## Who Is a Good Candidate?

Ideal candidates have:
• Adequate jawbone density
• Healthy gums
• Good overall health
• Commitment to oral hygiene

Age isn't a barrier—patients from 18 to 90+ successfully receive implants.

## Benefits of Dental Implants

Understanding what are dental implants means knowing their advantages:

• **Durability**: Last 25+ years with proper care
• **Natural appearance**: Blend seamlessly with existing teeth
• **Bone preservation**: Prevent jawbone deterioration
• **Improved function**: Eat and speak confidently

## Dental Implant Cost

Single implants typically range from $3,000-$5,000. Cost factors include:

• Number of implants needed
• Additional procedures required
• Geographic location

Most patients find them worth the investment for long-term oral health.
