# 5 Essential Dental Hygiene Tips for a Healthier Smile

Good dental hygiene tips can transform your oral health and boost your confidence. Simple daily habits make a huge difference in preventing cavities and gum disease.

## Essential Daily Dental Hygiene Tips

### 1. Brush Twice Daily
Brush your teeth for two minutes using fluoride toothpaste. Focus on all surfaces of your teeth, including the gum line.

### 2. Floss Every Day
Daily flossing removes plaque between teeth where your toothbrush can't reach. This prevents gum disease and bad breath.

### 3. Use Mouthwash
Antibacterial mouthwash kills harmful bacteria and freshens breath. Rinse for 30 seconds after brushing and flossing.

### 4. Replace Your Toothbrush
Change your toothbrush every three months or after illness. Worn bristles don't clean effectively.

### 5. Watch Your Diet
Limit sugary snacks and drinks. Choose water over soda and eat teeth-friendly foods like cheese and leafy greens.
