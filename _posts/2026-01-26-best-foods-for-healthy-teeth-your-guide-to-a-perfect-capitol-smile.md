# Best Foods for Healthy Teeth: Your Guide to a Healthier Smile

Your diet directly impacts your dental health. The right foods strengthen teeth, fight bacteria, and protect your smile naturally.

## Top Foods That Strengthen Your Teeth

Crunchy fruits and vegetables act like natural toothbrushes, scrubbing away plaque while you chew.

**Power Foods for Your Teeth:**
- **Apples and carrots** boost saliva production to wash away bacteria
- **Leafy greens** provide calcium that strengthens tooth enamel
- **Cheese** neutralizes harmful acids in your mouth
- **Nuts** deliver essential minerals like phosphorus and magnesium
- **Fatty fish** supply vitamin D to help your body absorb calcium

## Dairy and Beyond: Dental Superstars

Dairy products contain calcium and phosphorus that actively rebuild tooth enamel. Milk, yogurt, and cheese strengthen teeth from within.

Green tea fights bacteria naturally. Its antioxidants reduce gum inflammation and freshen breath.

Water remains your teeth's best friend. It rinses away food particles and maintains proper saliva flow.

## Foods to Limit for Better Dental Health

Sugary snacks and acidic drinks weaken enamel over time. Sticky candies cling to teeth, feeding harmful bacteria that produce enamel-damaging acids.
