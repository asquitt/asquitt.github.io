# Emergency Dental Care Washington DC: After-Hours Treatment Guide

Dental emergencies don't follow business hours. When severe tooth pain strikes at midnight or you chip a tooth on the weekend, knowing where to find emergency dental care Washington DC becomes crucial for your health and comfort.

## Recognizing True Dental Emergencies

Not every dental issue requires immediate attention. True emergencies include:

- Severe, throbbing tooth pain
- Knocked-out or broken teeth
- Uncontrolled bleeding from the mouth
- Facial swelling affecting breathing or swallowing
- Lost fillings causing sharp pain

These situations need prompt professional care to prevent complications and preserve your oral health.

## Immediate Steps Before Treatment

Take these actions while seeking emergency care:

- Rinse your mouth with warm salt water
- Apply cold compress to reduce swelling
- Save any broken tooth pieces
- Take over-the-counter pain medication as directed
- Avoid extremely hot or cold foods

For knocked-out teeth, handle only by the crown and try to reinsert gently. If unsuccessful, store in milk until you reach professional care.
