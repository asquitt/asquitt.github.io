# Root Canal Treatment Washington DC: When Dental Implants Become Necessary When your tooth is severely damaged, you face a critical decision: can root canal treatment save it, or do you need a dental implant? Connecticut Ave Dental Studio serves the Washington DC community with comprehensive solutions for both scenarios. ## Understanding Root Canal Treatment Root canal treatment removes infected tissue from inside your tooth. We clean the canals, eliminate bacteria, and seal the space. This saves many damaged teeth, but sometimes extraction and implant replacement is your best option. ## What Are Dental Implants? Dental implants replace missing tooth roots with titanium posts placed in your jawbone. A crown attaches on top, creating a natural-looking tooth. They're stronger and more permanent than bridges or dentures. ## Benefits of Dental Implants Implants offer key advantages: - Last 20+ years with proper care - Look and feel like natural teeth - Protect surrounding teeth from shifting - Maintain jawbone health and structure - No special cleaning beyond normal brushing ## The Treatment Process Our team makes treatment straightforward. First, we evaluate your oral health to determine if root canal treatment can save your tooth. If extraction is necessary, we can often place the implant during the same visit. Healing takes 3-6 months as the implant bonds with your jawbone. Finally, we attach your custom crown for complete restoration. ## Why Choose Professional Care in Washington DC? Our experienced team uses modern equipment and proven techniques to maximize success rates for both root canal procedures and implant placement. We help Washington DC residents preserve their smiles with the most appropriate treatment. ## Schedule Your Consultation Don't wait with tooth pain or damage. Our professionals will evaluate whether root canal treatment can save your tooth or if an implant offers the better solution.
