# Emergency Dental Care Washington DC: After-Hours Treatment Guide

When dental pain strikes after hours, finding emergency dental care Washington DC can feel overwhelming. Knowing what steps to take can save your tooth and reduce your discomfort.

## Immediate Steps for Dental Emergencies

First, stay calm and assess the situation. For severe pain, rinse your mouth with warm salt water. If you have a knocked-out tooth, handle it by the crown and try to reinsert it gently.

For bleeding, apply gentle pressure with clean gauze. Never use aspirin directly on gums as it can cause burns.

## When to Seek Emergency Dental Care Washington DC

Some situations require immediate attention:

- Severe, persistent tooth pain
- Knocked-out or loose teeth
- Broken or cracked teeth
- Swelling in your face or gums
- Bleeding that won't stop

For non-life-threatening emergencies, contact your dentist's emergency line. Hospital emergency rooms can help with trauma but typically can't provide complete dental solutions.

## Don't Wait for Relief

Delaying emergency dental care Washington DC can lead to more serious complications and higher costs. Quick action often means the difference between saving and losing a tooth.
