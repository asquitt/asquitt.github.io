# When to See an Emergency Dentist in Washington DC: Urgent Care Guide

Dental emergencies don't wait for convenient times. Knowing when to seek immediate care can save your tooth and prevent dangerous complications.

## Critical Signs Requiring Immediate Attention

Seek urgent dental care immediately for:

- **Severe, persistent tooth pain** - Often indicates infection or nerve damage
- **Knocked-out teeth** - Must be treated within 30-60 minutes for best results
- **Facial swelling** - Can signal dangerous infection spreading to surrounding tissues
- **Uncontrolled bleeding** - May indicate trauma requiring immediate intervention
- **Lost fillings exposing nerves** - Creates risk of infection and severe pain
- **Jaw injuries** - Can affect breathing and require emergency assessment

## When Emergency Room vs. Emergency Dentist

Contact an emergency dentist for tooth-related pain, broken restorations, and oral injuries. Visit hospital emergency rooms for facial trauma, difficulty swallowing, or breathing problems.

Emergency rooms manage pain and infection but rarely provide definitive dental treatment.

## DC Emergency Dental Response

Washington DC emergency dental services operate on triage principles. Life-threatening infections and trauma receive priority treatment.

Most emergency visits involve pain management, temporary repairs, and infection control. Definitive treatment typically follows once the emergency is stabilized.
