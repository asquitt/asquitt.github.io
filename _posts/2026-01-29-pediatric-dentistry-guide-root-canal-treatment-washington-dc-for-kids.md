# Pediatric Dentistry Guide: Root Canal Treatment for Kids in Washington DC

When your child needs root canal treatment, specialized pediatric dentistry ensures their comfort and safety. Connecticut Ave Dental Studio in Washington DC provides gentle dental care tailored for young patients facing complex procedures.

## When Children Need Root Canal Treatment

Root canals save teeth when infection reaches the inner pulp. Watch for these warning signs:

- Severe tooth pain that won't go away
- Swelling around the tooth
- Hot or cold sensitivity
- Tooth turning dark or gray

Saving primary teeth keeps proper spacing for adult teeth and supports healthy jaw growth.

## The Treatment Process

Our team carefully removes infected tissue and cleans inside the tooth. We then seal it with safe materials to prevent new infections.

We use child-friendly techniques to reduce anxiety. Comfort measures and gentle approaches help your child feel secure throughout treatment.

## Preparing Your Child

Use positive words when talking about the visit. Say we're "helping the tooth feel better" instead of scary terms. Bring their favorite stuffed animal or blanket for comfort.

## Recovery Care

Expect mild discomfort for 1-2 days. Give prescribed medicine on schedule and offer soft foods initially. Avoid hard, sticky, or very hot foods for several days.
