# Emergency Dentist Washington DC: Urgent Dental Care When You Need It Most

Dental emergencies strike without warning in Washington DC. Severe tooth pain at midnight, a knocked-out tooth during weekend sports, or sudden swelling can't wait for regular office hours. Finding an emergency dentist Washington DC quickly can save your tooth and prevent serious complications.

## When to Seek Urgent Dental Care

These situations require immediate attention from a dental emergency Washington DC professional:

- Severe tooth pain disrupting sleep or daily activities
- Knocked-out or loose teeth from trauma
- Broken crowns or fillings creating sharp edges
- Facial, gum, or jaw swelling
- Uncontrolled bleeding after injury

## Immediate Steps for Dental Emergencies

Take these actions before reaching professional care:

**Knocked-out teeth:** Handle by crown only. Rinse gently and attempt reinsertion. If impossible, store in milk or saliva.

**Severe pain:** Rinse with warm salt water. Apply cold compress for swelling. Never place aspirin directly on gums.

**Broken teeth:** Save fragments. Rinse mouth with warm water. Cover sharp edges with dental wax or sugar-free gum.
