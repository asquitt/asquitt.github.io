# Emergency Dental Services Washington DC | Connecticut Ave Studio

Dental emergencies don't wait for convenient times. When you're dealing with sudden tooth pain or dental trauma, you need immediate care. Connecticut Ave Dental Studio provides comprehensive emergency dental services to help you through urgent situations in Washington DC.

## Common Dental Emergencies in Washington DC

Dental emergencies can happen to anyone, anywhere. Knowing what qualifies as an emergency helps you act quickly.

### Severe Tooth Pain
Intense, throbbing pain that won't go away needs immediate attention. This often signals infection or nerve damage requiring prompt professional care.

### Knocked-Out Teeth
Time is critical with knocked-out teeth. The sooner you receive treatment, the better chance of saving your tooth.

### Broken or Cracked Teeth
Severe breaks that expose nerves cause extreme pain. Even small cracks can worsen without prompt care.

### Lost Fillings or Crowns
Exposed tooth structure becomes vulnerable to bacteria and further damage.

## What to Do During a Dental Emergency

Staying calm helps you make better decisions. Here's what to do before reaching our office:

### For Severe Pain
- Rinse with warm salt water
- Use cold compress on outside of cheek
- Take over-the-counter pain medication as directed
- Avoid placing aspirin directly on gums

### For Knocked-Out Teeth
- Handle tooth by crown, not root
- Rinse gently with water if dirty
- Try to reinsert in socket if possible
- Store in milk or saliva if you can't reinsert

### For Broken Teeth
- Save any pieces you can find
- Rinse mouth with warm water
- Apply gauze to bleeding areas
- Use cold compress for swelling
