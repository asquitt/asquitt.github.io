# Emergency Dental Services Washington DC: What to Do When Your Dental Implant Fails After Hours

A throbbing dental implant at 2 AM can turn your night into a nightmare. When implant failure strikes outside regular office hours in Washington DC, knowing how to respond can save your implant and prevent serious complications.

## Critical Warning Signs Requiring Emergency Care

Don't ignore these implant failure symptoms:

- Severe, persistent pain or throbbing
- Swelling around the implant site
- Loose or shifting implant
- Continuous bleeding
- Bad taste or pus discharge
- Fever or infection signs

These symptoms indicate potential implant failure or infection. Quick action protects your oral health and investment.

## Immediate Steps for Implant Emergencies

When complications occur after hours:

Rinse gently with warm salt water to reduce bacteria. Apply a cold compress for 15-20 minutes to control swelling. Take over-the-counter pain medication as directed. Avoid putting pressure on the affected area.

Never attempt self-repair. Improper handling can cause permanent damage to surrounding tissues and compromise your implant's future.
