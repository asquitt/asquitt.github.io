# Top 5 Signs You Need Emergency Dental Care

Dental pain can strike at any time. Knowing when to seek emergency dental care can save your tooth and prevent serious complications. Connecticut Ave Dental Studio in Washington, DC helps you recognize urgent dental situations.

## Critical Warning Signs for Emergency Dental Care

### 1. Severe Tooth Pain
Intense, throbbing pain that won't go away signals a serious problem. This often means infection or nerve damage requiring immediate attention.

### 2. Knocked-Out Tooth
A dental emergency needs treatment within an hour for the best chance of saving your tooth. Keep the tooth moist and get help fast.

### 3. Uncontrolled Bleeding
Bleeding that won't stop after 10 minutes of pressure indicates trauma. This urgent dental situation needs professional care right away.

### 4. Severe Swelling
Facial swelling, especially with fever, suggests serious infection. This can spread quickly and become life-threatening without treatment.

### 5. Broken or Cracked Teeth
Large fractures expose nerves and invite bacteria. Sharp edges can cut your tongue or cheek, creating additional problems.
