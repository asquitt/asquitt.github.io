# Dental Implants: Everything You Need to Know

Missing teeth affecting your confidence? For Washington, DC residents, dental implants offer the most reliable solution for tooth replacement, restoring both function and your natural smile.

## What Are Dental Implants?

Dental implants are titanium posts surgically placed into your jawbone to replace missing tooth roots. They create a permanent foundation for replacement teeth that look, feel, and function like your natural teeth.

Each implant system includes three components:

- Titanium implant post
- Abutment connector  
- Crown or replacement tooth

## Why Choose Dental Implants in Washington, DC

The benefits make implants the gold standard for tooth replacement:

- Last 20+ years with proper care
- Look and feel completely natural
- Prevent jawbone deterioration
- Protect surrounding healthy teeth
- Easy maintenance with regular brushing

## The Treatment Process

Getting dental implants typically requires 3-6 months. The process begins with placing the titanium post. Your jawbone then heals and integrates around it. Finally, your custom crown is attached.

Most patients report minimal discomfort throughout the process.

## Are You a Candidate?

Ideal candidates have:

- Healthy gums and adequate jawbone
- Good oral hygiene habits
- Realistic treatment expectations

Cost varies based on individual needs. However, implants offer excellent long-term value compared to repeated bridge or denture replacements.
