# Top 5 Signs You Need a Dental Checkup in Washington DC

Don't wait for severe pain to visit your dentist. Recognizing early warning signs protects your oral health and saves money on extensive treatments.

## Warning Signs That Require Immediate Attention

### 1. Persistent Bad Breath
Chronic bad breath signals gum disease or tooth decay. Regular brushing won't solve underlying bacterial buildup below the gum line. This condition requires professional treatment.

### 2. Bleeding or Swollen Gums
Healthy gums don't bleed during brushing. Red, swollen gums indicate gingivitis or gum disease. Without treatment, this progresses to periodontitis and potential tooth loss.

### 3. Tooth Pain or Sensitivity
Pain when eating hot, cold, or sweet foods suggests cavities or enamel damage. Sensitivity often worsens without professional intervention.

### 4. Loose or Shifting Teeth
Adult teeth shouldn't move or feel loose. This indicates advanced gum disease requiring immediate care. Bone loss around tooth roots causes this symptom.

### 5. White Spots or Dark Areas
White spots show early decay where minerals have dissolved. Dark areas suggest advanced cavities. Both need treatment before requiring extensive procedures.

## Why Regular Checkups Matter

Washington DC residents face unique challenges like stress and high coffee consumption that affect oral health. Scheduling a dental checkup in Washington DC every six months catches problems early. Professional cleanings remove plaque buildup that causes disease.
