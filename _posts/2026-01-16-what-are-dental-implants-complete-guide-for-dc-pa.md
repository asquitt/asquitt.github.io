# What Are Dental Implants: Complete Guide for DC Patients

Missing teeth affecting your confidence? Dental implants are titanium posts surgically placed into your jawbone to replace missing tooth roots. These permanent solutions have become the gold standard for DC residents seeking natural-looking tooth replacement.

## How Dental Implants Work

Dental implants fuse with your jawbone through osseointegration. This creates a rock-solid foundation for crowns, bridges, or dentures. The three-part system includes:

- Titanium implant post (artificial root)
- Abutment (connector piece) 
- Crown (visible tooth portion)

## Benefits for Washington DC Patients

Unlike dentures or bridges, implants preserve your jawbone and surrounding teeth. They provide:

- Natural appearance and feel
- Improved chewing ability
- Long-lasting durability (20+ years)
- No impact on adjacent healthy teeth
- No daily removal or special cleaning

## The Implant Process

Our dental studio uses advanced technology for patient-first care throughout your journey:

1. Initial consultation and 3D imaging
2. Implant placement surgery
3. Healing period (3-6 months)
4. Custom crown attachment

## Investment and Candidacy

Dental implants in DC typically cost $3,000-$5,000 per tooth. Most patients with healthy gums and adequate jawbone are excellent candidates. Age isn't a limiting factor—we've successfully placed implants for patients from 18 to 90.
