# Dental Insurance FAQ: Coverage & Payment Options Guide

Navigating dental insurance can transform your care experience. Understanding coverage helps you save money while receiving exceptional treatment.

## What Does Dental Insurance Typically Cover?

Most plans cover:
• Preventive care (cleanings, exams) - 100%
• Basic procedures (fillings, extractions) - 70-80%
• Major treatments (crowns, bridges) - 50%

## How Do Deductibles Work for Dental Care?

You'll pay your deductible before coverage begins. Most dental plans have annual deductibles ranging from $50-$100. Preventive services often bypass deductibles entirely.

## What Payment Options Are Available?

Beyond insurance, discover these proven payment solutions:
• Flexible payment plans
• CareCredit financing
• HSA/FSA accounts
• Cash discounts

## Does Insurance Cover Cosmetic Procedures?

Traditional insurance rarely covers cosmetic treatments. However, procedures that restore function (like crowns) often qualify for coverage.

## How Can I Maximize My Benefits?

Smart strategies include:
• Schedule cleanings early in the year
• Use your annual maximum
• Plan major treatments strategically
• Verify coverage before treatment

## What About Pre-Authorization Requirements?
