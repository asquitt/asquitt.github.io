        <h1>About Sunrise Dental Care</h1>

        <p>Sunrise Dental Care was founded in 2008 by Dr. Maria Gonzalez with a simple mission: to provide exceptional dental care in a warm, family-friendly environment. What started as a small practice with two treatment rooms has grown into one of Austin's most trusted dental offices, serving thousands of patients across the greater Austin metro area.</p>

        <p>Our practice is built on the belief that dental health is an essential part of overall well-being. We take a holistic approach to dentistry, considering each patient's complete health history, lifestyle, and goals when developing treatment plans. This personalized approach has earned us a loyal patient base and numerous referrals from satisfied families.</p>
